import React from 'react';
import NewsPageIndex from './NewsPage/Index'; // The main announcement board

// You would use this if you want a shared header/footer layout only for News pages.
// Since you want NewsPageIndex (the board) on the main /news path, 
// we'll just import the specific component we need in App.jsx.

// --- Skip creating a separate layout file and use the specific imports below ---
